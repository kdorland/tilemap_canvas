tilemap_canvas
==============

Prototype of a HTML5 Canvas tile engine for games.

I made this during the late part of 2011. I was an attempt to create a tile engine for games, using the HTML5 Canvas tag. WebGL was out of the question since I wanted it to work with all modern browsers. I dropped the project for various reasons, mostly performance-related. I also wanted better networking support and got tired of some of the shortcomings of Javascript. Today I would probably have used LibGDX with GWT backend or Haxe instead.
